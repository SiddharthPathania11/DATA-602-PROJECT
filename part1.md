INTRODUCTION:

We will be working on American Express - Default Predictions dataset from kaggle via api. We will be analyzing different attributes of the given datasets, performing prescriptive, descriptive and predictive analysis to get the likelihood that the customer using the credit card will default or not.We will implement different machine learning and deep learning models to ensure a best fit model with highest accuracy.

STEPS INVOLVED(Tentative):

1.DATA CLEANING:-
  Remove Duplicate,
  
  Error Handling,
  
  Data Validation

2.DATA PREPROCESSING:-
  Filling NaN values and Missing Values,
  
  Format check all every single column,
  
  Dimensionality Reduction techniques like PCA , T-SNE,
  
  Feature importance,
  
  Feature selection.

3.EDA

4.Feature Engineering

5.Train different ML and DL Models.

6.Hyperparameter tuning for the best model fit and minimizing the the required loss function.
